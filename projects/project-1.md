summary: First group project I've made in computer science.
---

ICS 111 was my introduction to computer science and programming. Instead of a final exam there was a final project that was completed in groups. With the Pokemon Go craze going on at the time my team decided to make a Pokemon game for our final.

The game was a Pokemon battle simulation where the player could select one of four attacks in a turn based fight against the computer. The battle would carry on until one of them has run out of health points.
 
Although the project itself was crude and rough around the edges, it was important to me because I enjoyed working with my group to create the game. It was during this time that I decided computer science is the right path for me.
