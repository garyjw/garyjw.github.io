# Why would I do this?
This <a href="https://github.com/garyjw/FlappyDemo">project</a> was my attempt to recreate the renown mobile app flappy bird. The purpose of this project was to create something not connected to school so that I can put the knowledge I've learned in class in practice. So instead of using Eclipse I used Android Studio and looked up how to utilize the tools offered in Android Studio.

# What does it do?
In my recreation of flappy bird, I used <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCO9JvZ75Usyzgd1puurLF6A">Brent Aureli's create flappy bird series</a> as a guide. This project makes use of a game framework created by BadLogicGames called libGDX, which provides various tool such as a physics engine and an orthographic camera. My attempt at recreating flappy bird was similar to the original with the exception of a score keeping system. The game consisted of several modes such as a main menu and game mode.The player would be able to make the bird jump by tapping or clicking on the screen during the game mode.
