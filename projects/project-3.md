# What is Munchie Zone?
Munchie Zone is a UH webpage that is developed so that students can order food from restaurants and have it delivered through deliveries services such as Bite Squad and Uber Eats. However, the predicament is that such services may have a minimum order count or charge extra fees that might be more than a single student can afford. The solution? Munchie Zone is designed so that a student can create a pending order for a time period that allows other students who may also be looking to order from the same restaurant to hop into the order. Features of this webpage include creating an order of your own or browsing other people's orders and joining in on it.
