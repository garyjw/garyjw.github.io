## Introduction

  Meteor is a developers tool that I was only recently introduced to and to my surprise it possibly has been the one of the highest hurdles that I have yet to jump. There are a couple of problems that I've encountered which include not understanding the inputs, layout, and syntaxs of meteor and having unknown refreshing errors.

## Problems
  Getting to know how meteor works was probably the hardest part because until now I have been working with environments that guide you and can correct your mistakes. However, when working with meteor on the terminal if something was wrong, well it just didn't work. And when it does print out the error it floods the terminal with error messages, that I have no clue how to interpret. How I sort of overcame part of this issue was by studying and learning how meteor works, but it'll take some more time to fully understand.
  
  Aside from that, meteor has been having refreshing problems when trying to update the codes I've typed in. It would display a message indicating that it is mid-refresh or show that its tried refeshing x amount of times. I'm not sure how long this mid-refresh would take as I've canceled meteor after 10 minutes of waiting. Also if i recall correctly meteor would print out in the terminal that it has finished refreshing but now it doesn't do that.

## Conclusion
  Overall my thoughts on meteor are that it isn't something bad, it is actually quite useful. The only drawback is the learning curve which is quite high unless you've experienced something else that is similar to it.
