## Introduction
With obesity rates rising rapidly in America it is no surprise that majority of the people you come across are gluttons. The internet is no different, with over 90% of questions posted are from people who love to be spoon fed answers. For software engineering, you will see that forums are littered with questions that are not asked in a manner where the problem is easy to identify and answer with precision. In "How To Ask Questions The Smart Way" Eric Raymond, states that such questions are unlikely to be met with an adequate answer. So how does one seek help and receive what they're looking for?

## How Not To
Before seeking help from others it is important to try and answer the question yourself first. You can often find answers to problems by doing a simple search as it is rare that the problems you stumble across are unique to yourself, meaning you will often find answers online. If that does not work out, you may want to try reading the manual or looking through FAQs. If you have to resort to asking another person it is important to show that you've done the steps previously mentioned. In this <a hreh="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45670264/how-to-delete-every-third-element-as-a-loop-from-an-array" > example </a> you can see that the question is immediately met with comments stating to show that the poster has done work before hand.
