## Overview
The problem: After a semester ends some students have leftover materials, books, and useful items from their previous classes. And don't want to throw them away, sell their books back to the bookstore, or hassle with advertisement.

The solution: Campus Trader, is an application where students can set up their own barter/exchange proposals for their unwanted school items.

To use Campus Trader, a student must log in with their verified University of Hawaii account and create a profile that holds all their available exchangables along with what they're seeking in return. The exchangable comes with it's background information, such as reviews from the user, condition of the item, category of the item(such as bio, ics, business, etc), and it's weight in value.

Important design goals for Campus Trader are:
  - To encourage reuse of items that would be thrown away
  - To make it easier to find items that would not be found on campus stores
  - To save time by having all items in one place
