Have you tried translating a doctor's handwriting into English? I'd say trying to understand another person's code leaves the same impression, confusion, unless there exists a coding standard that every programmer can follow. ESLint with Intellij provides a standard in coding by flagging your code until you've changed it to meet its standard, in return you are given a green checkmark that indicates your code is acceptable. My first week of using ESList with Intellij consists of being bombarded by the constant nagging from ESLint and the painful process of striving for that green checkmark.

After a week, ESLint has gone quite quiet with the exception of a flag popping up every now and then. It was during class, while comparing lines of codes with my peers in class, that I realized the significance of the green checkmark and a coding standard. We spent less time adjusting to individual coding styles which led to much more efficient coding. For example, when I was working on a practice Workout of the Day with a partner in class, we were able to get a lot of work done because it took little to no time to look back and forth between each other's laptop screens and understand what is typed out.

I think that the significance of coding standards are often overlooked as it doesn't actually have anything to do with being able to type out functional code. However, most programs are not written by an individual so a standard becomes a necessity inorder to provide an environment suitable for everyone.
