## Introduction

At first glance learning meteor is quite a daunting task. At least it was to me, in the beginning it was like starring at a massive meteor hurtling towards my brain. However, in time as I used meteor more and more the size of the meteor shrunk, don't get me wrong though it's still big but just not as much as before. 

## Difficulties
All things have a learning curve and meteor is no exception. To me, learning meteor is like trying to run through a succession of brick walls. The first brick wall was trying to get used to the terminal since it was my first time using it, so in a sense it was like learning two things are once. After that was trying to understand what each function does and the various collections and tools that meteor has for you to use, and figuring out what to run on the client and server.

## Easiness and Interesting Aspects
Just to make things clear, straight out of the box, nothing about meteor was easy. However, with exposure and repetition some aspects of meteor become easy and almost ritualistic such as cding into your directory, doing a npm install, running meteor, and then opening the provided localhost link. What I found intesting about meteor was the automatic update of your code to the localhost, which may upset seasoned meteor users as there are possibly much more interesting aspects of meteor than this, but I thought it was pretty cool.
