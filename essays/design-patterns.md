## What is this?
Imagine grabbing a drink from the fridge and pouring it into a glass of ice. Most likely you'll end up leaving drops of it on the counter, which you have a certain towel nearby for. And each time you go for a drink you leave behind tiny puddles and your most natural instinct is to use that very towel to wipe up the mess. Your kitchen towel is probably revered by the entire household for it's ability to constantly solve spills.

## How can you use it?
Well lets tone down the anarchy that is spilled milk and dial it down to a much more mild problem, my codes. I've probably encountered more errors in my code than cried over spilled milk, however luckly for me there are several design patterns that I can use to help alleviate my errors. One that I've found myself using the most is a prototype. If there is something very similar to what I want I can simply copy it and alter it so that it meets my specifications. This makes the process of handling problems much more simplier.

## The Wrap
A design pattern is a repeatable solution to commonly occuring problems such as spilling something or trying to figure out how to implement something. There are various design patterns that fall into three categories creational, structural, and behavioral patterns, all of which can help you solve your problems quicker to reduce the amount of salt and tears.
